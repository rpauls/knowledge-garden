# How Cursor Indexes Codebases Fast

## Summary

The Engineers Codex article explains how `Cursor` makes code‑base indexing fast by chunking files locally, hashing each chunk, and building a Merkle‑tree of those hashes. The hashes serve as keys for a cached embedding store, so identical chunks are reused across runs. When a project is opened, `Cursor` uploads only the chunks whose hashes are missing from the remote cache, drastically cutting bandwidth and processing time. Because the Merkle tree lets Cursor pinpoint exactly which files changed, subsequent indexing are incremental: unchanged files stay cached, while only the modified ones are re‑embedded and sent. This design yields near‑instant re‑indexing even for large repositories while keeping the raw source encrypted and filenames obfuscated on the server.

## Key Points

- **Local pre‑processing** 
	- Cursor performs the initial chunking and hashing on the developer’s machine; no raw source leaves the device until a new hash is detected.
- **Merkle‑tree structure** 
	- By arranging chunk hashes in a Merkle tree, Cursor can compare the root hash of the current state with the previously stored root to detect any change with a single hash comparison.
- **Embedding cache keyed by chunk hash** 
	- Each unique chunk’s vector embedding is stored once; repeated occurrences across files or revisions reuse the same cached embedding, eliminating redundant computation.
 - **Incremental upload workflow** 
	 - Only chunks whose hashes are absent from the remote cache are transmitted, reducing both network traffic and server‑side processing dramatically for large codebases.
- **Security posture** – Filenames are obfuscated and code chunks are encrypted before leaving the client; the server never sees plain‑text source, preserving confidentiality while still enabling semantic search.
- **Fast re‑indexing on reopen** 
	- When a project is reopened, Cursor checks the Merkle tree; if the root matches the stored one, it skips indexing entirely, giving an instant “ready” state.
- **Scalable to massive repos**
	- Because the cost grows with the number of changed chunks rather than total file count, Cursor remains responsive even for monorepos containing thousands of files.
