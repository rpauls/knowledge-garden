# 📚 RPauls Knowledge Garden

Welcome to my **Knowledge Garden** - a personal, growing repository of ideas, notes, and discoveries. This vault is organized around three main pillars:

1. **Software Engineering** – design patterns, architecture, dev‑ops, tooling, code snippets, and best practices.
2. **Technology & Trends** – emerging tech, product deep‑dives, tutorials, and industry news.
3. **Science & Curious Finds** – bite‑size explanations of scientific concepts, experiments, and anything that sparks curiosity.

**Disclaimer:** All personal views, interpretations, and opinions expressed in the notes within this vault are solely my own and do not represent any organization, employer, or third‑party entity.
## 🎯 Purpose

- **Capturing** insights quickly (notes, article highlights, code experiments).
- **Organizing** them for easy retrieval and cross‑linking.
- **Evolving** the garden over time—add, refactor, and prune as my interests shifts.

## 🌱 Growing the Garden

- **Cross‑link liberally** – The power of a knowledge graph lies in connections.
- **Create MOCs (Maps of Content)** – High‑level overview pages that act as tables of contents for each domain.
- **Iterate** – Revisit old notes, refactor outdated sections, and add new insights.

### 🎉 Happy Gardening!

May the vault blossom with knowledge, curiosity, and elegant solutions. If you ever feel stuck, remember:

> _“A garden thrives when you tend to it regularly.”_
