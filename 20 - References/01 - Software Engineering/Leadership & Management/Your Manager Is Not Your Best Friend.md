# Your Manager Is Not Your Best Friend

## Summary

The article argues that a manager’s role should remain professional rather than that of a confidant or best friend. While friendly, competent managers naturally attract employees who want to commiserate, such informal sharing can become “organizational poison,” eroding trust and creating factions within a team. Effective managers must practice _highly conditional empathy_: they should seek the truth of a situation respectfully instead of making their team feel good. When emotional venting arises, the manager should close that door and follow up with concrete actions, separating emotion from decision‑making. By maintaining clear boundaries and focusing on problem‑solving, managers foster a healthier, higher‑trust environment that supports collaboration and productivity.

## Key Points

- **Professional Boundaries**
	- Managers should avoid becoming personal confidants; allowing commiseration can damage organizational cohesion.
- **Conditional Empathy**
	- Empathy must be applied selectively to uncover facts and drive effective solutions, not merely to provide comfort.
- **Prompt Emotional Management** 
	- Close the window on venting and transition to actionable follow‑up, preventing lingering negative emotions from influencing the team.
- **Trust Building** 
	- Clear, fact‑focused communication builds trust and reduces factionalism, leading to stronger collaboration.
