# Feynman Technique

## Summary

The Feynman Technique is a learning method developed by physicist Richard Feynman that involves four steps: selecting a concept, teaching it to someone else (or an imaginary audience), identifying gaps in your understanding, and simplifying the explanation. This technique helps deepen understanding and improve retention of information.

## Key Points

### Step 1: Choose a Concept

- Select a topic you want to learn.
- Write the name of the concept at the top of a blank page.

### Step 2: Teach It

- Explain the concept as if teaching it to someone else, preferably a child.
- Use simple language and avoid jargon.

### Step 3: Identify Knowledge Gaps

- While explaining, note areas where you struggle or use complex terms.
- These gaps show what you need to study further.

### Step 4: Refine and Simplify

- Go back to your study materials to fill in the gaps.
- Simplify your explanation until it's clear and concise.
