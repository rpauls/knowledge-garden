# This Is How You're Eroding Accountability

## Summary

The article outlines common ways leaders unintentionally undermine accountability on their teams and offers concrete fixes. It notes that accountability is essential for scaling work, yet managers often erode it through broken org charts, misaligned incentives, micromanagement, and taking over tasks instead of delegating. The piece stresses that these pitfalls are easy to spot and correct if leaders proactively audit structures, clarify expectations, and align rewards with outcomes. By addressing these hidden leaks - such as overlapping roles, unclear metrics, or harsh, fear‑based enforcement language - organizations can restore a culture where ownership thrives and results are reliably delivered.

**Key Points**

- **Broken Org Charts** 
	- Overlapping roles or overly deep hierarchies dilute responsibility; regular (6‑12 month) reviews help keep structures clean and accountability clear.
- **Misaligned Incentives** 
	- Rewards that don’t match desired outcomes encourage shortcuts and blame‑shifting; aligning compensation and recognition with results reinforces ownership.
- **Micromanagement & harsh, fear‑based enforcement language** 
	- Over‑controlling behavior and harsh phrasing create fear rather than ownership, eroding genuine accountability.
- **Taking Over Work** 
	- When managers redo drafts or solve problems themselves, they signal that the team isn’t accountable; delegating and providing constructive feedback restores responsibility.
- **Unclear Expectations** 
	- Vague goals lead to excuse‑making; restating clear, outcome‑focused expectations realigns the team and strengthens accountability culture
