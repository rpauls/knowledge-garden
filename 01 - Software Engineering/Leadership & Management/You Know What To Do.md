# You Know What To Do

## Summary

The article observes that experienced individuals who are close to a problem in most circumstances know the correct course of action, yet teams often delay decisions because they over‑rely on data, frameworks, or hierarchical decision making. The author warns against the “data‑driven cult” that seeks hidden nuances in situations that are actually straightforward, and stresses the importance of listening to knowledgeable insiders—even when their feedback is uncomfortable. External advisors can serve as useful “rubber‑duck” checks, confirming what the team already knows and helping gauge severity. By cutting through unnecessary analysis and acting prompt on the insights of those with context, organizations can avoid paralysis and improve execution.

## Key Points

- **Contextual Insight** 
	- People who work close with a problem almost always know the right move; their expertise should be trusted rather than sidelined.
- **Data‑Driven Pitfalls** 
	- An overemphasis on metrics and nuanced analysis can create false complexity, leading teams to wait for certainty that not exists in most cases.
- **Open Feedback Loops** 
	- Teams must welcome candid, sometimes uncomfortable, feedback from experts near the issue, even if it challenges senior or popular executives.
- **External Confirmation** 
	- Advisors or trusted friends can act as “rubber‑duck” partners, confirming the team’s intuition and helping assess the seriousness of a situation.
- **Act Quick** 
	- When the correct action is evident, execute it prompt instead of stalling for more data or approval.
