# The Precise Language Of Good Management

## Summary

The article argues that a manager’s words are a binding promise: the exact phrasing you use determines the outcomes you get. Most managers speak imprecisely - about long‑term, uncertain matters - because vague language feels safer. This habit creates confusion, misaligned expectations, and wasted effort. The piece outlines why managers fall into vague speech, shows common examples of imprecise language, and offers concrete ways to replace them with clear, actionable statements. By speaking precisely, managers set realistic expectations, improve accountability, and foster a culture where teams can move forward confidently.

## Key Points

- **Imprecise language is the norm:** 
	- Most managers naturally drift toward vague, flowery wording, this can specifically be seen when discussing future or uncertain topics.
- **Root causes:** 
	- Lack of data, fear of committing, and the desire to keep options open push managers to avoid specifics.
-  **Common pitfalls:** 
	- Phrases like`we’ll see how it goes`, `maybe later` or `let’s keep an eye on it` leave teams unclear about next steps and success criteria.
- **Replace with concrete statements:** 
	- Use measurable targets, deadlines, and explicit responsibilities (e.g., `by Friday, deliver a prototype of feature X and share metrics with the team`).
- **Benefits of precision:** 
	- Clear expectations reduce misunderstandings, increase trust, and enable faster decision‑making; teams know precise what to work on and can track progress objectively.

## Subtopics

### Practical tips:

- **Ask for data before answering** – base statements on evidence.
- **Define success criteria** – state what “done” looks like.
- **Set timeframes** – avoid “sometime”; give a specific date or milestone.
- **Assign ownership** – name the person or role responsible.

## Personal Thoughts

When managers consistently use precise language, they become more reliable partners, empower their teams, and drive better outcomes for the organization.
