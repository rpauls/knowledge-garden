# A Good Engineer

## Summary

The article argues that calling ourselves “software engineers” while holding computer‑science degrees masks a fundamental tension: science seeks explanations, whereas engineering builds reliable, usable systems. A good engineer prioritizes practical problem solving, empathy for users and teammates, iterative craftsmanship, and continual learning. When an organization adopts these same traits - clear vision, shared values, structured autonomy - it scales individual excellence into a robust engineering culture. The piece highlights web pioneers (e.g., Netscape’s SSL team) as exemplars of blending scientific curiosity with engineering rigor, urging us to recognize and nurture the distinct engineering mindset in both people and companies.

## Key Points

- **Terminology Gap**
	- The industry routinely calls developers “software engineers” despite most holding computer‑science degrees; recognizing this gap clarifies expectations around design versus implementation.
- **Engineering Mindset vs. Scientific Curiosity**
    - **Science:** explains _why_ something works.
    - **Engineering:** decides _how_ to make it work reliably in real‑world constraints. Good engineers blend both but lean toward the latter.
- **Core Engineer Traits**
    1. **Outcome‑focused problem solving:** Delivering functional, maintainable solutions over elegant theory alone.
    2. **User & teammate empathy:** Expect failure modes, consider operational impact, and communicate decisions precise.
    3. **Iterative craftsmanship:** Treat code as a living artifact, readable, testable, and refactorable.
    4. **Continuous learning with discipline:** Explore new tools and patterns, then apply them judiciously rather than adopting for novelty’s sake.
- **Translating Individual Traits to Organizational Culture**
    - **Shared Vision** acts as a north‑star, aligning trade‑offs and fostering purposeful innovation.
    - **Structured Autonomy** gives engineers freedom to experiment while maintaining safety nets (code reviews, CI/CD, post‑mortems).
    - **Feedback Loops:** Regular retrospectives and blameless incident analyses reinforce engineering rigor at scale.
- **Historical Precedent** 
	- Web pioneers (e.g., Netscape’s SSL team) combined deep scientific insight with disciplined engineering practices, setting a template for modern software organizations.
- **Hiring & Development Implications**
    - Look for candidates who show pragmatic problem solving and collaborative communication, not academic credentials.
    - Invest in mentorship programs that teach the engineering trade‑off mindset (reliability, observability, performance) alongside technical skills.
- **Actionable Takeaways**
    1. **Audit terminology**: Align job titles, onboarding material, and performance metrics with engineering outcomes rather than pure “science.”
    2. **Codify engineering principles**: Create a lightweight manifesto (vision, autonomy, safety) that guides decision‑making across teams.
    3. **Build tooling for iteration**: Adopt CI pipelines, automated testing, and observability stacks that enable rapid, safe experimentation.
    4. **Foster a learning culture**: Use regular “tech‑talk” slots where engineers share failures and lessons learned, reinforcing the engineering mindset.
